        <p>This page is just the amalgamation of anything non-academic that I felt like putting on this website.
        For example, I'm quite interested in linguistics. Constructed languages, specifically. Anecdotally, there seems to be
      some overlap between people who are into math and people who are into linguistics. From a philosophical perspective, I suppose they are similar subjects.</p>

        <p>If you're interested, feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/EvePidcock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> page. I can't guarantee that any of the code there is "good";
        some of it was written many years ago when I was in high school.</p>
